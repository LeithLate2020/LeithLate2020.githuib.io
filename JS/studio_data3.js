Three years later he and other organisers of the theatre's gallery space left the Traverse to establish what became the Richard Demarco Gallery.[1] The gallery, which doubled as a performance venue during the Edinburgh Fringe, ran from 1966 to 1992. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Demarco\">Wikipedia entry</a><br/><br/>Audio of Artist:<br/><audio controls=\"controls\"><source src=\"Audio/rd1.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></div><br/><div class=\"artist_name\">William Bonnar</div><div class=\"toggle\"></div><div class=\"content\"><img src=\"Images/wb.jpg\" class=\"artist\">Bonnar was born in Edinburgh in 1800. His father was Thomas Bonnar a house-painter and interior designer of considerable skill. Bonnar showed an early aptitude for drawing, and was apprenticed to one of the leading decorators of the time. When George IV visited Edinburgh in 1822, Bonnar assisted David Roberts in decorating the Assembly Rooms for the grand state ball which was given in honour of the occasion. Shortly afterwards some signboards painted by him attracted the notice of Captain Basil Hall, who sought out and encouraged the young artist. In the year 1824 his picture of 'The Tinkers ' established him as a favourite with the public, and shortly after the formation of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1830 he was elected one of its members. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bonnar\">Wikipedia entry</a></div>"
